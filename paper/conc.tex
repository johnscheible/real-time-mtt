\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

The primary contribution of this work was to determine the extensibility of the framework developed by \cite{choi2010multiple}
under real-time constraints. In order to accomplish this we replaced the Deformable Parts Model pedestrian detector with our
own simpler, real-time Sphero detector. Yet, the resulting framework was still unable to produce tracking results in real-time. Our
work has shown that while our RJ-MCMC algorithm may be capable of producing incredibly accurate results, to achieve such
results required extensive hand tuning on a per-situation basis. Such hand refinement made real-time use impractical.
Ultimately, the tuning requirement makes it difficult to utilize even a well designed RJ-MCMC framework.
