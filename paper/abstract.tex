% ABSTRACT

Real time tracking of multiple targets is an incredibly general and complicated form of the tracking problem. Keeping the concept
of identity assigned to 0 or more detections of a target is itself a challenging, but not un-heard of algorithm. Unfortunately existing
solutions tend to be extremely slow, relying on extensive pre-processing and computationally heavy probabilistic models to solve
the tracking problem. Many exciting applications of tracking, however, require real-time tracking. We present the results of
making modifications to one existing multiple-target tracking framework to eliminate pre-processing. We show that our modified
system runs at approximately the same speed as the original tracker, without the pre-processing. Finally, we present profiling of
the tracking system and identify opportunities to optimize and speed up the tracker itself.
