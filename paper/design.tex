Summary
- We're tracking spheres instead of humans
- Eliminated overhead of matlab detector
- Implemented realtime blob detector
- Dropped it into tracker

To best evaluate the performance of the system and assess whether a real-time solution was possible, our first step was to have
the entire system run as one process. This meant eliminating the preprocessing step that the original system required. This
preprocessing was a \emph{deformable parts model} pedestrian detector written in MATLAB. This step, as we show in our
evaluation, was the largest bottleneck. The preprocessing detection took approximately
