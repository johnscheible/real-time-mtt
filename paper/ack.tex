\section{Acknowledgments}
\label{sec:ack}

We would like to thank Professor Silvio Savarese and Wongun Choi for developing the original tracking system and advising
John in his previous work with the tracker. We would also like to thank Jie Li for her administrative support throughout the class.
Finally, we would not have been able to complete this project without the support and guidance of Professor Matthew
Roberson-Johnson.
